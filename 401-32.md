## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application?

* useReducer is a hook that helps to keep the event handlers short and concise (i.e. simplifies the event handling process). useContext is a hook that lets a parent component pass data to any child component within the application, without having to pass it down to each individual component in between.

* By using both useReducer and useContext, we are able to pass state to specific child components and have that state receive updates from certain events that we have setup our useReducer to listen for.
