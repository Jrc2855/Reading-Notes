# Authentication

## Securing Passwords

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.

- I would store your passwords in something called a hash function which stores a translated version of your password in the database as a hashed password. This means if someone breaks into the database and steals your password, they won't get anything but the translation (the hash).

2. What is Bcrypt?

- An adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.

3. Why might you use something like Bcrypt?

- It enables us to slow down an incoming brute force attack

## Basic Auth

1. What is Basic Authentication?

- A method of providing a user name and password when making a request.

2. What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?

- The ID and password joined by a colon

3. How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded?

- Using Base64

## OWASP auth cheatsheet

1. Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.

- Authentication is the process of charging people for a blue checkmark next to their name.
- Authentication is just making sure someone is who they say they are. Typically by asking them what their ID and password are, which only they should be the ones to know.

2. How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?

- Error messages should return a generic message. This is to protect the users information from anyone who might be trying to break in, and give them as few clues as possible.

3. Bookmark this link also and consider OWASP fundamentals any time you interact with authentication. Applications developed with security in mind from inception have fewer vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle.

- Ok!
