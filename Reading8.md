# CSS Layout, Flexbox

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

> You can control alignment in one axis at a time, you can either align things by their row, or their column but not both together at the same time.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

> With the Main Axis properties begin with 'justify', whereas with the Cross Axis they begin with 'align'

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

> 'Row-Reverse' and 'Column-Reverse' change the visual order for how elements on a screen are layed out. Unfortunately they won't change the logical order. This means that anyone using a screen reader will be unable to follow the same order as anyone using a keyboard without a screen reader.
