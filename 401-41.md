# React Native

## Getting Started with React Native

* Name Three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
  * View - A non-scrolling div. Also described as a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.
  * Image - Displays different types of images.
  * Scrollview - A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views.

* What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
  * React Native lets us build iOS and Android Mobile applications within React. It's called Native because it simulates a mobile "view" in a way where it looks natural within the application, instead of looking like a web application.

* What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
  * React Native comes with a set of "Native" Components. This is different from React, where you don't get any default components, you have to make the components yourself.

## Expo

* What solution does Expo Provide?
  * It seems like it simplifies the process of Creating, Publishing, and Debugging a mobile application.

* Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
  * We call it the Bare Workflow

* What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
  * React Native doesn't support HTML or CSS, Expo does.

## Expo Snack

* Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
  * It's similar to Replit, it lets us run code in the browser and simulate what it would look like on a mobile device.

## Ejecting

* What does "eject" mean within the context of Expo?
  * It means leaving the cozy comfort of the standard Expo development environment.

* When should you not eject?
  * When your development would benefit from not dealing with a build configuration or native code.

* Why might you choose to eject?
  * When you need to have full control over your native Android and iOS projects.
