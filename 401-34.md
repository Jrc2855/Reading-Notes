# API Integration

## Review API Server Build

1. Explain the difference between a query string parameter and a path parameter.

  * A query string parameter is appended to the end of a URL after the question mark, and is used to filter the results. A path parameter is part of the URL path itself, and is used to identify a specific endpoint on the server.

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:
  * Domain: http://our-site.com
  * v3
  * model name: stuff
  * id: things

  * http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.

* You can think of that "interface" like a menu at a restaurant. You make certain selections from the "menu" and our "waiter" (the API) returns to the kitchen to request our selection with the "chef" (server) Once the "chef" prepares our selection the "waiter" carries it back to us and presents us with our selection. This is done by rendering our requested info on screen. Or in my case, it's done by presenting me with an error that I then have to go and troubleshoot.

## Review Auth Server Build

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
  * I would use the middleware to check if the request has the necessary permissions. For Basic Auth it would check if the username and password match anything in the userbase, for Bearer Auth it would check if the JWT Token supplied with the request is authentic with anything in the userbase and if these match then access would be granted. If not then access would be denied.
2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.
3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
  * You can think of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) like employees in a company. Certain employees are allowed to access certain floors of the building, while others are denied that access.
