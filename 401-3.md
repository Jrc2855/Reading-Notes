# Express REST API

## ES6 Classes

1. Classes are a template for creating ___?
- Objects
2. Can a Class declaration be hoisted?
- No
3. How would you describe a constructor and contextual "this" to a non-technical friend?
- A constructor is a custom made method that is only used when an object gets created. Essentially it's a template for an object, and "this" refers to the object that was newly created within that specific constructor.

## Using Express Routing

1. Within Express, what does routing refer to?
- How an applications endpoints respond to client requests.
2. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
- A route method uses one of the HTTP methods (.get, .post, .put). A route path defines the endpoints that we use to make requests.
3. When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
- When you might need to bypass any remaining route callbacks. If you pass next as a parameter, you must provide the next object for your middleware.

## Express Routing

1. What is an Express Router?
- It's like a mini-Express application. It provides us with our routing API's like .use, .get, .param, and route
2. By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?
- We'll need to call an instance of express.Router(), apply routes to it, and then tell our application to use those routes.
3. What do we use route middleware for?
- To do something before a request is processed.
