# Data Modeling

## NoSQL vs. SQL

1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

- SQL Databases

2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL Databases

3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means you can enhance a single server. Whereas NoSQL Databases are horizontally scalable, which means you can add more servers.

## SQL Modeling Techniques

1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

- A one-to-many relationship means an entry in one table can be related to many entries in another table.

2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

- Create a Diagram of the Database tables and their relationships

3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

- A primary key is essentially an ID for a single table record. A foreign key is an ID within a table record that matches the primary key of a different table.

## SQL vs. NoSQL

1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

- Keywords need to be Capitalized.

2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

- Essentially it forces a template for our data to follow.
