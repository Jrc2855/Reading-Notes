## AWS SQS Vs. SNS

1. What is the difference between SQS and SNS?

* SNS is a publish-subscribe system which means messages are pushed to subscribers when they are sent by publishers.
* SQS is a Distributed Queing system, which means that messages are not pushed, but subscirbers have to poll SQS to receive their messages.

2. What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?

* SNS - Use if you want to publish and consume several messages, and if you have several subscribers.
* SQS - Use if you only have one subscriber, and you need to be able to decouple two applications which allows for asynchronous sending and receiving.

## AWS SNS and SQS

1. Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a "fanout" pattern.

* You can publish messages to several subscribers (fan out) of different types with SNS.

2. Explain how "push notifications" work, using SNS.

* By publishing a message from SNS. It sends out the message to all of the subscribers.

## SQS and SNS Basics

1. How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS?

* By having the SQS subscribe to an SNS to receive any messages that are published, and then entering that message into a queue until the user is ready to view/ process it.
