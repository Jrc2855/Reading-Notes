# What does .map() return?
  A new array


# If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  You would need a <li> element for each item and then you would assign the array to an element (in the example they called theirs listItems) and then you would include the listItems array inside of a <ul> element. 

# Each list item needs a unique ____.
  A key

# What is the purpose of a key?
  To help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed

# What is the spread operator?
  An ellipsis of three dots (...) that expands an iterable object into the list of arguments.

# List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
  Spreads an array into separate arguments
  Adding an item to a list
  Adding to state in React
  Combining Objects

# Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
  let hello = {A,B,C}
  let world = {1,2,3}
  let helloWorld = {...hello,...world}
  console.log(helloWorld) // Returns {hello: "A,B,C", world: "1,2,3"}

# Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
  let moreNumbers = ['4','5','6']
  let numbers = ['1','2','3', ...moreNumbers]
  console.log(numbers) // Returns ['1','2','3','4','5','6']
