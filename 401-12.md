## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
  * WebSocket is the communication protocol that allows for bidirectional communication, Socket.IO is a library that uses the WebSocket protocol.
2. When would you use Socket.IO?
  * When you're able to take the shortcuts afforded to you by using a library.
3. When would you use WebSockets?
