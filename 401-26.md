# Component Based UI

## React Quick Start 

1. What are the building blocks of a React app?

* Components

2. What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?

* React Components have to start with a capital letter.

3. What is JSX and why do we use it?

* JSX is a markup syntax we use for syntax, basically it lets us write HTML into our React Apps.

4. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.

* You have to wrap the JavaScript in curly brackets.

5. Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?

* You can use a ? as a conditional operator instead of an if statement.

6. How does React know to respond to a userâ€™s inputs?

* Through Event Handlers.

7. What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?

* When functions start with 'use' they are called hooks.

8. How can two react components share data?

* By moving state from one component to the other.

## Render and Commit

1. What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?

* Triggering a render, Rendering the Component, and committing to the DOM.

2. How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?

* By calling createRoot with the target DOM node, and then calling its 'render' method with your component.

3. Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?

* No, it will only rerender if there have been any changes that need to be displayed.

4. After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?

* The browser still needs to render the application.
