# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

> We wrap text around the <'a'> element.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

> The href contains the web address to the webpage we're using.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

> By not putting the URL into the link text
> Not using the word 'link' in the link text
> Keep the link text as short as possible
> Avoid placing multiple links near each other if their link text reads the same.

## CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

> The standardized layout for elements on a webpage when no CSS has been applied.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
___ positioning is the default for every html element.

> Block level elements fill the available inline space
> Inline elements sit adjacent to any other text that is within the width of the parent element

3. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

> It lets you create focal points on your page without messing with the entire pages layout
> It gives you more exact control of where you place your element because it doesn't have to follow the normal document flow

4. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

> Absolute positioning keeps the element in place on the screen, where as fixed positioning keeps the element in place on the web page.

## JS Functions

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

> The Declaration is where the Function is initially established. The Invocation is where the Function is called or applied.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

> A parameter is the requirement for the function to be called. The Argument is the value passed into the function when it is called.

## Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

> Programmers are more likely to be engaged on their coding when they work within a pair.
> They can also learn from each other. By explaining code to another student it helps to reinforce what they know, or by having it explained to them sometimes they can receive some necessary perspective to help them gain a deeper level of understanding.
