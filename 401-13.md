# Reading 13: Message Queues

## Socket.io Chat Example

* Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

  * It uses a Server as a middleman between two separate clients(users). The Server listens for messages from either user and then relays it to the other.

* What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

  * We're Console logging when a user connects or disconnects

* Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

  * We would use the broadcast flag

## Rooms

* What is a room and how might a room be useful?

  * An arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.

* How do you join a room?

  * By calling the socket.join method.

* How do you leave a room?

  * By calling the socket.leave method

## Namespaces

* What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

  * A Communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection. You can have certain Namespaces have specific functions, such as admin rights.

* Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

  * Event Handlers
  * Rooms
  * Middlewares

* Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces

  * For creating a page that gives Admins, specific access to various information they might need.
