# Bearer Authorization

## Intro to JWT

1. What is a JSON Web Token(JWT)?

* A way to securely transmit information between parties.

2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?

* During Authorization, of a user's privileges. And during Information Exchange between two parties where the info is better kept private.

3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?

* The Header, Payload, and Signature

## Are JWTs Secure?

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?

* Because you need the Payload and the Secret. Just knowing the Payload alone won't be enough to see the content.

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, it's appended in the signature.

* The Hash with the Payload + the Secret

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.

* The sender and receiver both know a secret. When the JWT is received both parts of the Hash are checked to make sure they line up.
