# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An Introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain Middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter

- Middleware is a type of software that lets different software applications communicate with each other.

2. Express the most popular ___

- Node Web Framework

3. Express is "unopinionated". What does that mean?

- An opinionated Framework will typically encourage the "right" way to handle a task. An unopionated Framework does not encourage any particular method of dealing with any tasks. For example I think of Autocorrect on Cellphones.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- Modules are easier to troubleshoot because we can test these isolated segments of code individually. It also lets us reuse code as many times as we need.

## What is NPM?

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- 9.3.1

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint' into your node project?

- npm i jshint

## What is TDD?

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- Tests help me make sure my software does what I expect it to do.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing?

- Reduction in Defect Rates
- Smoother effort towards the end of development
- More organized code being written

3. Name at least 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

Individual Mistakes 

- Forgetting to run tests frequently
- Writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained

Team Mistakes

- Not everyone will use Test Drive Development
- The tests can become poorly maintained which will lead to long running times.

## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- Potentially catch bugs
- Reduce Merge Conflicts
- Improved Confidence that our software will work as intended.

2. What is the difference between coninuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- Continuous Delivery means we build code that 'could' potentially be released at any time
- Continuous Deployment means we Release the code as soon as its built.

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.

- Github is like a clearing house for our code. We push our code to Github which will then check if there will be any issues combining our new code base with our old code base.
