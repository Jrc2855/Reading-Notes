# The Node Ecosystem

## What is Node?

* According to the Node Developers: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine. In english this means Node runs JavaScript code to allow Developers to build server side applications. In even simpler english, this means that we can use JavaScript to write the code for the Front end and the Back end.

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

## Additional Questions

4. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

* I'm curious about our 2nd class, how we are going to write our own Tests. I always imagined that would be something I wouldn't learn to do until I was a pretty experienced Dev, so this is surprising to me, and I'm curious to see how it goes.

5. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

* I want to be able to explain how we employ Continuous Deployment. I have a vague understanding for how to do it, but I want to improve my understanding to the point where I can explain it in detail.
